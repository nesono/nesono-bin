# README

This change set is just to create a PR and try out some stuff. Do not merge!

## Description

Useful helper scripts for all purposes. See the documentation and comments in
each file for usage.

## Installation

The repository could be (but is not restricted to be) cloned into the home directory of the user, e.g. by
```
cd ~/  
git clone git://github.com/nesono/nesono-bin.git
```

For installation (sourcing in original dotfiles, etc.)
simply invoke
```
~/nesono-bin/install_nesono-bin
```

The installation script might be invoked several times without
harming your settings.

For a nice git setup (git needs to be installed already), invoke
```
git_setup.sh
```
