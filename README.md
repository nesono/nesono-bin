## Description

Useful helper scripts for all purposes. See the documentation and comments in
each file for usage.

## Installation

The repository should be cloned into the home directory of the user, e.g. by
```cd ~/
   git clone git://github.com/nesono/nesono-bin.git```

For installation (sourcing in original dotfiles, etc.)
simply invoke
```~/nesono-bin/install_nesono-bin```

The installation script might be invoked several times without
harming your settings.

For a nice git installer, invoke
```git_setup.sh```
